# CS335-compiler-design
This repository houses the assignments submitted by me as part of the university course of CS335: Compiler Design at IIT Kanpur. The task of each assignment was as follows:

+ [<u>Assignment 1</u>](./A1/): The assignment was based on lexical analysis and required the usage of Flex to scan codes in a toy language and Fortran and report stats of lexemes present in the input. <br> 10/100 marks deducted in private cases. They all emerged from incorrect detection of comments in Fortran.
+ [<u>Assignment 2</u>](./A2/): The assignment was based on the underlying theory of parsers as well as to construct a parser of our own for the given language specification. <br> No marks were deducted.
+ [<u>Assignment 3</u>](./A3/): This was a theoretical assignment based on SDDs (Syntax-Directed Definitions) and IR (intermediate representation). <br> No marks were deducted.
